  // mount effect calls `useAuthStore.persist.rehydrate()`, which happens
  // AFTER this component's own first render/effect. Evaluating `isAllowed`
  // before that finishes sees the store's hardcoded pre-hydration default
  // (`activeRole: 'doctor'`) instead of the real signed-in role, so a
  // correctly-authenticated real user on a hard page reload gets bounced
  // through the DEFAULT role's dashboard first, then a second redirect
  // (once rehydration lands) corrects it to their own — a jarring, and on
  // a slower load, sometimes-observable double-redirect. Gate on hydration
  // completion so this only ever evaluates once, against the real state.
  // `.persist` is only meaningful client-side (its storage getter reads
  // `localStorage`, which doesn't exist during Next.js's server render of
  // this "use client" component) — read it only inside an effect, never
  // during render, so this never runs/throws on the server.

    // no fallback, `hydrated` would stay false forever and every role-gated
    // page below would show an infinite "Redirecting..." spinner with no
    // recovery. If real hydration hasn't finished within a few seconds,
    // force `hydrated` true anyway — `currentUser` will still be whatever
    // the pre-hydration default is (or null), so this degrades to "treated
