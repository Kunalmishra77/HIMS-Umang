// Client-side read of the on-duty DOCTOR roster from real profiles.
//
// Reception's registration doctor dropdown used to offer only the static mock
// roster (src/lib/opd.ts OPD_ROOMS), whose names match no real profile — so a
// patient "assigned" to a doctor never appeared in that doctor's real queue
// (the doctor dashboard filters by `patient.doctor === currentUser.name`).
// This reads the actual signed-in doctors so reception can assign to a name the
// doctor dashboard will actually match.
//
// Gated by RLS (profiles_select_doctors_staff) to signed-in staff. Returns [] on
// any error / no session, so every caller can fall back to OPD_ROOMS with no
// regression.
